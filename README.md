# Github_Parser

A Github Parser written in Python3 which accepts username as input and shows various statistics of the user.

# The Working Procedure: 

1. The user is prompted for username on github when the program **scraper.py** is run.

2. With the given username, the parser extracts the user data from github and shows the number of repositories created/forked by the user.

3. Then, the parser provides the user with the choice of parsing any repository present in the list.

4. Now as the repository is being parsed the corresponding directories are simultaneously created in the same folder as the one in which **parser.py** is being run.
