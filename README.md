# Github_Parser

A Github Parser written in Python3 which accepts username as input and shows various statistics of the user.

# The Working Procedure: 

1. The user is prompted for username on github when the program **scraper.py** is run.

2. With the given username, the parser extracts the user data from github and shows the number of repositories created/forked by the user.

4. Now as the repository is being parsed the corresponding directories are simultaneously created in the same folder as the one in which **parser.py** is being run.
